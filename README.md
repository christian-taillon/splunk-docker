# splunk-docker
Repository for splunk-docker deployment

### Podman
Use of docker's docker-compose for podman is only supported in podman version 3.0.0-dev and above. It is the preferred method for containerizing Splunk. Use run-podman.sh script for deployment with podman.

### Docker
Docker may also still be available on your system. If use of Docker natively is desired run the run-docker.sh script.
